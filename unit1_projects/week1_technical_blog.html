            <ul>
                <li>Why is this one of your favorite sites?<br/>
                    <span class="answer">Beautiful designer furniture, rare antiques, vintage couture, and in-depth interviews with artists, architects, interior designers and art dealers.</span><br/><br/>

                </li>
                <li>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?<br/>
                    <span class="answer">The featured products stand out immediately. The slow cycling slideshow temps users to start shopping.</span><br/><br/>

                </li>
                <li>How would you describe the website visually? <br/>
                    <span class="answer">Colorful, clean, engaging, full, sorted.</span><br/><br/>

                </li>
                <li>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?<br/>
                    <span class="answer">The site needs to inspire desire, and promote an air of exclusivity. Like any high-end brick and mortar store, it needs to make customers comfortable with high prices.</span><br/><br/>

                </li>
                <li>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?<br/>
                    <span class="answer">Appealing, desirable, exclusive, rare, artistic. Since the site is also operating as a sort of magazine, the botique allure of the photos is often diminished by the sheer amount of visual information on the page. That being said, everything is well organized and presented, so the page's fullness isn't too distracting.</span><br/><br/>

                </li>
                <li>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?<br/>
                    <span class="answer">Navigation is intuitive, but sometimes the site can be a bit slow.</span><br/><br/>

                </li>
                <li>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?<br/>
                    <span class="answer">The content is easily browsed, but the search function is often slow and sometimes even broken.</span><br/><br/>

                </li>
                <li>How do you feel after being on the site for a while?<br/>
                <span class="answer">Poor. Just really really poor.</span> <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?<br/>
                    <span class="answer">I've never bought anything on 1stDibs, but I have sold quite a few items through my galleries.</span><br/><br/>

                    <span class="answer">The point as I see it is inspiration. Before and after photos of remodels, step by step instructions for refinishing thrift store finds, it's a great resource for projects, not products.</span><br/><br/>

                <li>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?<br/>
